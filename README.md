Contrails Detection:
Contrails, short for "condensation trails," are the visible cloud-like trails sometimes left behind by aircraft in the sky. Detecting contrails is important for understanding their environmental impact on climate and weather patterns.

Project Overview:

The project is about finding a range of models that can be best used for the task of contrails detection. In this code, we experimented with a variety of ways to preprocess, augment, hyper-tune, and test our data and models.

Model Exploration: The project aims to explore a range of different models for contrails detection. This involves experimenting with DeepLabv3+, PSPNet, Unet, and FCN to identify which one performs best for our specific task.

Data Preprocessing: This includes tasks like resizing images, normalizing pixel values, handling missing data, and more. Effective preprocessing can significantly improve model performance.

Data Augmentation: Data augmentation involves creating variations of your existing data by applying transformations like rotations, flips, zooms, and more. This can help prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization capabilities.

Hyperparameter Tuning: This involves adjusting parameters like learning rate, batch size, number of layers, and other settings to achieve better results.

Model Evaluation: This compares the performance of different models using evaluation metrics. This will help you understand which model is performing the best for contrails detection.

Kaggle Notebooks: Kaggle provides a platform for data science competitions, and Kaggle Notebooks allow us to run code on their servers without needing to download the entire dataset. This is useful for large datasets that might be cumbersome to work with locally.
